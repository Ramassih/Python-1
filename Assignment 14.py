    Challenge: Handle negative exponents efficiently.
    ====================================
    Description: Develop a function named      power that takes two integers, base and exponent,
     as input and returns base raised to the power of exponent.

def power(base, exponent):
    if exponent < 0:
        base = 1/ base
        exponent = -exponent
    results = 1
    for _ in range(exponent):
        results *= base

    return results

print(power(2,-5))
